Description:
    The controller generator creates stubs for a new controller and its views.

    The generator takes a controller name and a list of views as arguments.
    The controller name may be given in CamelCase or under_score and should
    not be suffixed with 'Controller'. 

    The generator creates a controller class in app/controllers with view
    templates in app/views/controller_name, a helper class in app/helpers,
    and a functional test suite in test/functional.

Example:
    >> generate controller CreditCard open debit credit close

    Credit card controller with URLs like /credit_card/debit.
        Controller: app/controllers/credit_card_controller.php
        Views:      app/views/credit_card/debit.tpl [...]
        Helper:     app/helpers/credit_card_helper.tpl
        Test:       test/functional/test_CreditCardController.php
