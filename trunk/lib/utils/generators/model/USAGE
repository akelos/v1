Description:
    The model generator creates stubs for a new model.

    The generator takes a model name as its argument.  The model name may be
    given in CamelCase or under_score and should not be suffixed with 'Model'.

    The generator creates a model class in app/models, a test suite in
    test/unit, and test fixtures in test/fixtures/app/models/.

    You can set the initial columns for the Model table. This will be added to
    the first version in this model migration.
    
Example:
    >> generate model Account

    This will create an Account model:
        Model:      app/models/account.php
        Installer:      app/installers/account_installer.php
        Test:       test/unit/account_test.php


    >> generate model Video title, length double, author, is_searchable
    
    This will create a video model and an installer with selected columns.
