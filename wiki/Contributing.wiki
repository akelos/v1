Tickets are fine, but patches are great. If you want to change something in the Akelos Framework or fix a bug you've run across, there's no faster way to make it happen than to do it yourself.

== Get the Akelos Framework ready for patching ==
   * Check out the trunk using: "_svn checkout http://akelosframework.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ akelos_"
   * Setup your environment in a way to be able to run the unit tests.
== Make a test-driven change ==
   * Add or change unit tests that would prove that your change worked.
   * Make the change to the source.
   * Verify that all existing tests still work as well as all the new ones you added by running ./script/test unit and ./script/test path_to_your_test.php
== Share your well-tested change ==
   * Create a patch with your changes: svn diff > my_properly_named_patch.diff
   * [http://code.google.com/p/akelosframework/issues/entry Create a new ticket] with [_PATCH_] as the first word in the summary and upload (not paste) your diff.
   * Keep an eye on your patch in case there are any reservations raised before it can be applied.

Please make sure you read the [http://akelos.org/Akelos%20Framework%20Developer%20Coding%20Style%20Guide.pdf Akelos Framework coding guidelines] before writing *large components* for the Framework
