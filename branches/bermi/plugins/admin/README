Admin Plugin
===================================


This plugin assists you to create a basic admin with RBAC permission, role and user management.

It is not meant to be used as a fit all solution but as a simple to adapt/modify base for your applications.

As Akelos itself the Admin plugin it's based on simple conventions for building navigation and handling user permissions.

The user permission interface is heavily inspired by Drupal.
