SifrHelper is an Akelos version of the Ruby on Rails plugin created by Rob Morris that allows simple, drop-in use of the sIFR 2.0
font-replacement technique in your Akelos views.  Use it to bring any TrueType font to your website in a cross-platform,
browser neutral manner.  Rails SifrHelper's home is at: http://thecodingway.com/code/sifrhelper


== What is sIFR?  
The full story can be found here: http://www.mikeindustries.com/sifr

The quick version is that sIFR is a drop-in, accessible, gracefully degrading technique for 
richer typography (aka more fonts) in your web designs.  
Using flash swf files containing a given font definition, a set of Javascript 
functions cleverly overlay a Flash object over specified
text elements, injecting the text on the way, and rescaling to fit as best as possible.

Simply put, sIFR lets you use TrueType fonts on any platform - without rendered images or other nastiness.


== Installing the plugin
Install the SifrHelper plugin using the following command.

  ./script/plugin install http://svn.akelos.org/branches/bermi/plugins/sifrhelper


== Installing a font
sIFR requires a swf file for every font you want to use on your site.  To generate these font files, you need a working copy of
Flash MX or similar, and the sIFR source bundle.  Follow the directions on the main sIFR site about how to build the swf files. 
You can also go to http://thecodingway.com/code/sifrfonts to download pre-built font files that Rob Morris has created, or google for
"sifr fonts".  Go nuts!

Once you have a valid swf, just drop it in your ./public/fonts/ directory, named "<font face>.swf".  That's it.

To start you off, SifrHelper comes with the Xpressive font in the folder sample_fonts.  This is a 2.0.5 font file.


== OK, now how do I use a font?
Easy!  Add two calls to your layout:

  <head>
  <%= sifr_head_generator -%>
  </head>
  <body>
  ...
  <%= sifr_body_generator -%>
  </body>

That's all you need for setup.  Now, say you had a view with text like so:

  <h1 class="cool_font">Some Header Text</h1>

To change this from default font of boringness to the much cooler Xpressive font face, you'd put the following at the top of your view:

  <% sifr_replace('.cool_font', :xpressive) -%>

That's it!  The helper sets up the sIFR javascript options, includes the needed stylesheets, and handles locating it all for you.  You can
use any valid CSS selector in sifr_replace's first parameter, so go nuts.
