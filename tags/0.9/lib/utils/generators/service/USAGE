Description:
    The service generator creates stubs for a new Web Service resource.

    The generator takes the name of an existing API definition as its argument.  
    The API name may be given in CamelCase or under_score and should not be 
    suffixed with 'API'.

    The generator creates a service class in app/models.

Example:
    >> generate service Todo

    This will read the API settings from:
        app/apis/todo_api.php
        
    This will create an Account model:
        Service Model:      app/models/todo_service.php
