This provides a PHPUnit-TestSuite for the Akelos_Framework.

Requirements
------------

[PHPUnit](http://www.phpunit.de/) itself must be installed separate. [(Installation guide)](http://www.phpunit.de/pocket_guide/3.2/en/installation.html)
The recommended and supported way is to use the PEAR-installer. 

    pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
    pear install phpunit/PHPUnit 
    
That's it. You can test your installation by executing 

    phpunit
    
which will print a help message.

Run a test
----------

This TestSuite has its own script (script/test_runner.php) to run your tests. Basically it includes lib/PHPUnit_Akelos which registers the autoloader and includes the config-file (test/fixtures/config/).
Addionally it creates TestSuites from directories or files on-the-fly.

    script/test_runner.php
    
will print a help message. 

Try

    script/test_runner.php -v examples/
    
from the root-folder of *this* package. Study these examples, hopefully they're quite self-explanatory. Some of the examples rely on fixtures (an installer f.i.) you can find in tests/fixtures/.
