Makelos Plugin
===================================

This plugin contains Makelos, a simple PHP build program with
capabilities similar to make and rake.

Makelos has the following features:

* makefiles.php (makelos's version of Rakefiles/Makefiles) are completely defined in
  standard PHP syntax.  No XML files to edit.  No quirky Makefile
  syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)

* Makelos supports rule patterns to synthesize implicit tasks.

* A library of prepackaged tasks to make building makefiles.php easier.


Installation
--------------------------------

    ./script/plugin install makelos


Usage
--------------------------------

Run

    ./makelos -T

to see available tasks

You can see example makelos.php task declarations on ./lib/tasks/db/
