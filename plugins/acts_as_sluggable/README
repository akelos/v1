Acts as Sluggable Plugin
===================================

This plugin is inspired by:
http://code.dunae.ca/acts_as_slugable

Generates a URL slug based on a specific fields (e.g. title).

A url slug is a string derived from a specific field which can the be used in a URL.  For instance, a page with the title <tt>My page</tt> would have a URL slug of <tt>my-page</tt>.

The slug is generated on save actions.

URL slugs are unique within the specified scope (or all records if no scope is defined).  If the slug already exists within the scope, <tt>-n</tt> is added (e.g. <tt>my-page-0</tt>, <tt>my-page-1</tt>, etc...



Usage Examples
----------------

class MyModel extends ActiveRecord
{
    var $acts_as = array('sluggable'=>array('slug_source'=>'name','slug_target'=>'slug'));
}

Will take the value of $myModel->name and generate $myModel->slug.
The ActiveRecord must of course have the column defined in "slug_target"

class MyModel extends ActiveRecord
{
    var $acts_as = array('sluggable'=>array('slug_source'=>'getSlugName','slug_target'=>'slug'));
    
    function getSlugName()
    {
        return $this->name.' '.$this->number;
    }
}

Will call $myModel->getSlugName() to get the source value and generate $myModel->slug.

Installation
--------------------------------

    ./script/plugin install acts_as_sluggable


How acts_as_sluggable works
----------------------------

1. Stripping of all accented
2. Replacement of special chars with word representatives (@ becomes -at- etc.)
3. Remove double "-" dashes from the slug
4. Lookup the db for duplicate slugs and add increasing number "-0" at the end until its unique
5. set $record->{$slug_target} column with the generate value
